You will need to create a symlink for "loginshell_menu_dc", as the pam_adduser PAM module has the script name "loginshell_menu" hard-coded into it. This means that the DC pods' "loginshell_menu_dc" will not be recognized by the modified PAM module.

Create it as follows:

	ln -s loginshell_menu_dc loginshell_menu

Now the DC CMs will work properly.

You will also need the private keys for the Openstack VMs to be placed in the "keys" folder. You can get these private keys off of the Openstack web GUI and then scp them to the keys folder. The files exist, but there's nothing in them (I wasn't going to upload private keys to a repository). You will need to add the keys here yourself.
